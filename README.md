## Disney Character Game

Create a dynamic web page using JavaScript which will allow the user to play a game to randomly select a Disney character, and for a short biography of that character to appear on the page.

-   A Disney character should be randomly selected when the user clicks a button on screen to play the game.
-   Information about the character should also display on the page,
    -   For example: name, image of character, movie(s) they are in, friend or nemesis, song they may sing, quote they are known for, etc.
    -   This information should be displayed below the button and styled up using CSS.
    -   You may add additional biographical information if you wish.
    -   Your chosen characters can be a selection of Disney characters or they can all be from the same movie, especially if you have a favourite Disney film.
